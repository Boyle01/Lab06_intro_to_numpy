# TODO: refer to reading and slides from March 11 to fill in the code to find
# the quartiles


# Although I know that some may know how to write python functions, please only
# write a function if you know how it works. Otherwise, please write out the
# code linearly (and repetatively) as instructed on slide 19 and 20
# from March 11


# TODO: be sure to print out all the values that are of interest in an
# informative way

#%%
# TODO: use what you have implemented above to also compute the
# interquartile range, and print it out in an informative way.
